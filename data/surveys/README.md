povcal_time = % of population survyed for a small sample, and the max observed (2%) for country-years we know there is a survey but can't find sample

povcal_time_pop = number of individuals surveyed for all country-years with a survey. For surveys without an observed sample size, we assume the largest sample seen within country, to be conservative.
